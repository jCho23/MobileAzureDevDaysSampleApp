## Branching and Pull Requests Guidline

* Branches should be matched to a active Github issue.
* Always merge from master into your branch before creating a pull request. This will show you if you have any conflicts with the existing code base
* Never commit to master, you will be shamed
* Branches will be deleted after a Pull Request has been approved into Master.

## General flow for creating a new branch

1. Perform work in chunks and commit to your branch
  1. Make sure commit titles are meaningful
  1. Be descriptive in the title and the notes
2. Format code before creating pull request
3. Create pull request and reference issue in the comments. Assign all pull requests to @jCho23

## Code formatting guidelines:
All code should be formatted to our code guidelines. This will be considered in all pull requests and is a best practice to develop as a team. Please use David Siegel's cSharp styling guideline: https://github.com/dvdsgl/csharp-in-style
